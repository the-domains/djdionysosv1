description: "A tech share rally drove US stocks up sharply for a second day on Friday as earnings from companies including Microsoft beat analysts' expectations, while healthcare shares rebounded from recent losses. The gains left the S&P 500 in positive territory for the year and above its 200-day moving average for the first time since Aug."
